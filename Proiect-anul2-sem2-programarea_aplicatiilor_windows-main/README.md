# Project-year2-sem2-programarea_aplicatiilor_windows

I have coded the project in c#. I have used the visual studio 2019 code editor, with the c# windows development addon/install.

If you want to make any changes or run the program:
For stage 1:
You should be able to just run it in visual studio, after you install visual studio.

For stage 2:
You also have to place the database file from ./Resources/ into the ./bin/debug folder. Also you have to run User control and place the resulting dll(in the ./bin/debug from that solution) into ./bin/debug of the main solution.
